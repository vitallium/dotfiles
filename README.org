* Home
[[file:Home.org][Home configuration]] contains independent settings for my Linux and macOS boxes.
I try to keep them common as mush as possible which means this configuration contains 0 Xorg or Wayland stuff.
** X11
[[file:X11.org][X11]] configuration defines my settings for Xorg environment with ~i3~, ~rofi~ and ~dunst~.
** Sway
[[file:Wayland.org][Wayland]] configuration defines my settings for Wayland environment with ~sway~, ~wofi~ and ~mako~. It pretty much mimics the X11 configuration.
* Emacs
