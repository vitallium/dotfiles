  I need you to create a commit message for me based on these guidelines:

  - Analyze the provided diff carefully.
  - Include a subject line and a body with a list of more details.
  - The subject line should be followed by a blank line
  - The subject line should be a single line that is 50 characters or less.
  - If the changes only include 1 file, then the subject line should include the file name.
  - The body should use bullets if appropriate.
  - The lines in the body should wrap at 72 characters
  - Don't output anything except the commit message contents so I can easily copy and paste it.

  Here are the differences for the commit:
  <Diff>
    $input
  </Diff>
