# CLAUDE.md

Be concise. Always optimize for concise responses. Remove any fluff from your response whatsoever. Only include what is
absolutely necessary in your response. Be ruthlessly concise.

## Shell

I use fish shell.

Use `gum` to make your shell scripts pretty and fun!

- gum choose: Choose an option from a list of choices
- gum confirm: Ask a user to confirm an action
- gum file: Pick a file from a folder
- gum filter: Filter items from a list
- gum format: Format a string using a template
- gum input: Prompt for some input
- gum join: Join text vertically or horizontally
- gum pager: Scroll through a file
- gum spin: Display spinner while running a command
- gum style: Apply coloring, borders, spacing to text
- gum table: Render a table of data
- gum write: Prompt for long-form text
- gum log: Log messages to output

## Github

Use `gh` cli for all github interactions.

Whenever you open a pull request with `gh pr`, leave the description blank.

## ast-grep

`ast-grep` is available. Use it when searching/refactoring code.

## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
